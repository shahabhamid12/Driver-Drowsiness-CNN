Driver Drowsiness Detection using CNN
Overview
Detect and prevent driver drowsiness in real-time with this Python-based project using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Drowsy driving poses a significant safety concern, and this project aims to enhance road safety by monitoring the driver's behavior through a CNN-based approach, issuing alerts when signs of drowsiness are detected.

Features:

Real-time Monitoring:
Continuous monitoring of the driver's facial features through webcam access for immediate responsiveness.

CNN Model:
Utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network for accurate and robust drowsiness detection, ensuring high precision in identifying signs of driver fatigue.

Alert System:
Implements visual and audible alerts to promptly notify the driver upon detection of drowsiness, contributing to immediate corrective actions.
